    <p>Here is a sample of some of my recent work. I was tasked with creating a typographic poster for a concert I went to in one of my classes last term, and I chose one of my favorite bands, <em>Lightning Bolt.</em> I designed this poster and wrote the copy at the bottom! Click the poster to learn more about the band.</p>
